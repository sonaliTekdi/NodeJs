Todo List App:
1) Backend (Node.js): Create an API that allows users to create, 
read, update, and delete (CRUD) todo items. 
Each todo item should have a title and a completed status.
2) Frontend (React): Build a simple interface to display the list of todos,
 a form to add a new todo, and buttons to mark a todo as completed or delete it.
